1. Make sure you install all required modules correctly.

2. In config.conf line; SYMBIOT_SERVER: your IP. (space delimeted after ':').

2. Run Information-Control-System.py (main proogram).

3. Turn on indexing for fortmulaic file; play/run/open.

4. Turn on...

The fun part:
1. Place any of your code you wish to run by voice, in plugins directory.
2. Just say the name of the file and it will be run automatically!
	example: 'sony bravia turn on', runs sonybraviaturnon.py

This is a framework to run anything, control anything and to get
information about anything.

Automatic webcrawlers can be made to store information in Transcriptions 
directory that can be searched for by keywords and dictated on voice request,
this way you might not know whats there but you can query. (More auto
crawlers on key websites the better, for more information available on
request).
