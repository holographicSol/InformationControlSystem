Information And Control via voice. For enthusiasts, dev's and education.

A voice recognition information and control system framework that allows you to control potentially anything and get information on potentially anything.

Python 3.5 Windows 10

Symbiot is included as apk for android to start and stop speech recognition around the home. It is in its most basic form as i have only just made it.

Please be careful when Symbiot Server is active because currently it is not ssl and also any device on your network capable of running Symbiot can start the speech recognition thread.

End Goal: System will be installed on dedicated hardware and wired up around the home to multiple monitors and speakers, making information and control and media available anywhere in the home. 
GUI will be full screen (no desktop for linux/windows). Security goes without saying, be careful what you place in Plugins. Compatibility could be an enemy.
